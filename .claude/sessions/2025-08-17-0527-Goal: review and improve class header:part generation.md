# Session: Review and Improve Class Header/Part Generation
**Started:** 2025-08-17 05:27 UTC

## Session Overview
Development session focused on reviewing and improving the class header/part generation system in the NAGA monorepo scheduling application.

## Goals
- Review current class header/part generation workflows
- Analyze the ClassPartTemplate system and its integration with promotion services
- Identify improvement opportunities in the automated class creation process
- Evaluate the recently refactored ClassPartType choices and UUID7 implementation
- Optimize class structure generation for language programs vs academic programs

## Progress

### âœ… Issue Identified
**Script**: `apps/enrollment/management/commands/transitional/import_academiccoursetakers_enhanced.py`

**Problem Found**: The script is creating all ClassParts with:
- `class_part_type = ClassPart.ClassPartType.MAIN` (hardcoded)
- `name = "Main"` (default when normalized_part is null/empty)

**Root Cause**: The script completely ignores the `normalized_part` data from `legacy_course_takers` table, which contains actual language class types like "GRAMMAR", "READING", "VENTURES", etc.

**Impact**: All imported classes have generic "Main" parts instead of proper language class structure.

**Next Step**: User will decide on approach for fixing the ClassPart type mapping.
