### GraphQL Implementation (Strawberry)

**Why GraphQL**:
- Dashboard queries need data from multiple models (students, enrollments, grades, payments)
- Analytics require complex nested queries with aggregations
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates
- Reduced over-fetching for mobile clients
- Better type safety and introspection

**Schema Organization**:
```python
# backend/graphql/
├── types/
│   ├── student.py      # Student-related types
│   ├── academic.py     # Grade, enrollment types
│   ├── finance.py      # Payment, invoice types
│   ├── analytics.py    # Dashboard metric types
│   └── innovation.py   # AI predictions, automation
├── queries/
│   ├── student.py      # Student queries
│   ├── dashboard.py    # Dashboard data
│   ├── analytics.py    # Complex analytics
│   └── innovation.py   # AI/ML queries
├── mutations/
│   ├── grades.py       # Grade updates
│   ├── enrollment.py   # Enrollment changes
│   └── automation.py   # Workflow triggers
├── subscriptions/
│   ├── real_time.py    # Live updates
│   ├── notifications.py # Push notifications
│   └── collaboration.py # Real-time editing
└── schema.py           # Main schema assembly
```

**Key GraphQL Operations**:
```graphql
# Dashboard data in one query
query DashboardMetrics {
  studentMetrics { count, newThisWeek, atRisk }
  academicMetrics { gradesEntered, transcriptsPending }
  financialMetrics { totalRevenue, pendingPayments }
  systemMetrics { activeUsers, systemHealth }
}

# Complex student analytics
query StudentAnalytics($filters: StudentFilters) {
  students(filters: $filters) {
    id, name, successPrediction, riskFactors
    enrollments { course, grade, attendance }
    payments { total, outstanding, history }
  }
}

# Real-time grade entry collaboration
subscription GradeEntrySession($classId: ID!) {
  gradeEntryUpdates(classId: $classId) {
    studentId, grade, updatedBy, timestamp
  }
}
```

**Performance Optimizations**:
- DataLoader for N+1 query prevention
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Query complexity analysis and limiting
- Automatic persisted queries

## 🔍 Business Questions for Clarification

1. **Priority Ranking**: Which module should be completed first for maximum business impact?

2. **User Roles**: Are there specific user personas we should prioritize in the interface design?

3. **Integration Requirements**: Are there external systems (payment gateways, SIS, etc.) that need special consideration?

4. **Compliance Needs**: Are there specific educational compliance requirements (FERPA, etc.) we must address?

5. **Mobile Strategy**: Should we prioritize mobile-web or consider a native mobile app in the future?

6. **Data Migration**: What's the appetite for risk during the migration from Django to React interfaces?

7. **Training Resources**: How much time can be allocated for staff training on the new system?

8. **Budget Constraints**: Are there any budget limitations that might affect the scope of innovative features?

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Agent Spawn Strategy**: Launch all 6 agents in parallel using the new worktree
2. **Delegation to Sonnet**: Provide detailed implementation tasks to Sonnet agents
