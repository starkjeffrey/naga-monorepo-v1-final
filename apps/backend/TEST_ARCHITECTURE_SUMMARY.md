└── tests_legacy/            # Archived old tests
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Fresh Start**: Completely new test suite rather than refactoring legacy tests
2. **pytest Native**: Full adoption of pytest idioms and best practices
3. **Fixture-Heavy**: Extensive use of fixtures for DRY principles
4. **Parallel-First**: Tests designed for parallel execution with xdist
5. **Coverage-Driven**: Strict coverage requirements with automatic enforcement
6. **CI-Integrated**: Tests run automatically on every PR with multiple quality gates

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: pytest 8.0+ with pytest-django
- **Coverage**: pytest-cov with 85%/95% thresholds
- **Factories**: factory_boy for test data
- **Mocking**: unittest.mock with pytest fixtures
- **Parallel**: pytest-xdist for speed
- **Property Testing**: Hypothesis for edge cases
- **API Testing**: httpx, respx for HTTP mocking
- **Time Control**: freezegun for temporal testing

## 📊 Coverage Strategy

### Targets by Module Type

| Module Category | Coverage Target | Justification |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Core Business (finance, academic) | 95% | Critical for operations |
| Domain Models | 90% | Essential data integrity |
| API Endpoints | 85% | User-facing interfaces |
| Services | 85% | Business logic layer |
| Utilities | 80% | Supporting functions |
| Admin/Management | 70% | Lower risk internal tools |

### Measurement Points
- Pre-commit: Local coverage check
- CI Pipeline: Enforced thresholds
- Weekly Reports: Trend analysis
- Quarterly Reviews: Target adjustments

---

## 🚦 Quality Gates

Every code change passes through 8 validation steps:

1. **Syntax Check** - Python parsing
2. **Type Check** - mypy validation
3. **Lint Check** - Ruff analysis
4. **Security Scan** - Bandit + Safety
5. **Unit Tests** - Fast, isolated tests
6. **Integration Tests** - Database/service tests
7. **Contract Tests** - API compliance
8. **Coverage Check** - Threshold enforcement

## 🏆 Success Metrics

After 30 days, measure:

| Metric | Current | Target | Method |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Code Coverage | ~40% | 85% | `make coverage` |
| Test Count | ~50 | 500+ | `pytest --collect-only` |
| Execution Time | N/A | <5 min | CI metrics |
| Flaky Tests | Unknown | <1% | Test reports |
| Bug Escape Rate | Baseline | -50% | Issue tracking |

## 🚀 Next Steps

The foundation is complete. The team should now:

1. **Week 1**: Set up environments and create first tests
2. **Week 2**: Achieve coverage targets and enable CI
3. **Week 3**: Train team and establish processes
4. **Month 2**: Expand test suite to all apps
5. **Month 3**: Add performance and security testing

## 📝 Final Notes

This test architecture provides:

- **Confidence**: Comprehensive testing catches issues early
- **Speed**: Parallel execution and smart test selection
- **Quality**: Enforced standards and automated checks
- **Visibility**: Clear metrics and progress tracking
- **Maintainability**: Well-organized, documented test suite

The test suite is not just about finding bugs—it's about building confidence, enabling refactoring, and supporting rapid development with safety nets.
