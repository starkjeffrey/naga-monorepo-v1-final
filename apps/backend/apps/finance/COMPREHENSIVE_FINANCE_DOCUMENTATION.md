## üîß Technical Implementation Guide

### Financial Service Architecture

```python
# 10 Specialized Financial Services
PricingService              # Course pricing calculations with adjustments
InvoiceService             # Invoice generation and management
PaymentService             # Payment processing and verification
BillingAutomationService   # Event-driven automatic billing
GLIntegrationService       # General ledger integration
QuickBooksService          # External accounting sync
CashierService            # Cash operations and reconciliation
TransactionService        # Financial audit trails
ReceiptService            # Receipt generation
ReportService             # Financial reporting and analytics
```

### Key Business Logic Methods

#### **SERVICE Accounting Revenue Recognition**

```python
def record_payment_with_revenue_recognition(payment):
    """Record payment using SERVICE accounting principles"""
    # 1. Verify payment received
    if payment.status != PaymentStatus.VERIFIED:
        raise ValueError("Can only recognize revenue for verified payments")

    # 2. Create financial transaction (audit trail)
    FinancialTransaction.objects.create(
        transaction_type=TransactionType.PAYMENT_RECEIVED,
        amount=payment.amount,
        description=f"Payment received from {payment.student}"
    )

    # 3. Create journal entry for cash received
    journal_entry = create_cash_received_journal_entry(payment)

    # 4. Sync with QuickBooks (cash transaction)
    QuickBooksService.sync_cash_transaction(payment)

    # Revenue is now recognized - not when invoice was created!
```

#### **Automatic Pricing Calculation**

```python
def calculate_course_price(student, enrollment):
    """Calculate appropriate price based on course type and enrollment"""
    course = enrollment.class_header.course

    # Check for special pricing
    if course.code == "COMEX-488":
        return get_special_course_price(course, student.is_foreign)

    # Check for reading class tiered pricing
    if course.is_reading_class:
        enrollment_count = get_current_enrollment_count(enrollment.class_header)
        return get_reading_class_tier_price(enrollment_count, student.is_foreign)

    # Check for senior project pricing
    if course.is_senior_project:
        group_size = get_senior_project_group_size(enrollment)
        return get_senior_project_price(group_size, student.is_foreign)

    # Default course pricing
    return get_default_course_price(course, student.is_foreign)
```

#### **Multi-Payment Method Processing**

```python
def process_payment(payment_data):
    """Process payment based on method with appropriate verification"""
    method = payment_data['payment_method']

    if method == PaymentMethod.CASH:
        return process_cash_payment(payment_data)
    elif method == PaymentMethod.BANK_TRANSFER:
        return verify_bank_transfer(payment_data)
    elif method == PaymentMethod.MOBILE_PAYMENT:
        return verify_mobile_payment(payment_data)
    elif method in [PaymentMethod.CREDIT_CARD, PaymentMethod.DEBIT_CARD]:
        return process_card_payment(payment_data)
    else:
        return process_other_payment(payment_data)
```

### Database Performance Optimizations

```python
# Efficient student balance calculation for SERVICE accounting
def calculate_student_balance(student):
    """Calculate balance based on verified payments only"""
    return {
        'total_invoiced': student.invoices.aggregate(
            total=Sum('total_amount')
        )['total'] or Decimal('0.00'),

        'total_paid': student.payments.filter(
            status=PaymentStatus.VERIFIED
        ).aggregate(
            total=Sum('amount')
        )['total'] or Decimal('0.00')
    }

# Efficient pricing lookup with historical support
def get_effective_pricing(course, pricing_date=None):
    """Get pricing effective on specific date"""
    if not pricing_date:
        pricing_date = timezone.now().date()

    return CoursePricing.objects.filter(
        course=course,
        effective_date__lte=pricing_date,
        is_active=True
    ).order_by('-effective_date').first()
```
