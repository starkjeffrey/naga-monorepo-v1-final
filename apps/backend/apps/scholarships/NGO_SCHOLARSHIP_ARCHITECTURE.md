# NGO Scholarship Architecture

## Overview

The scholarship system has been elegantly split into two types:

1. **NGO-funded scholarships** - Managed through `SponsoredStudent` relationships
2. **Non-NGO scholarships** - Individual scholarships using the `Scholarship` model

This design eliminates data duplication while providing a unified interface for the finance system.

## Key Design Principles

### 1. No Data Duplication
- NGO scholarships use existing `SponsoredStudent` relationships
- Discount percentage comes from `Sponsor.default_discount_percentage`
- No need to create individual `Scholarship` records for NGO students

### 2. Date-Based Validation
- Scholarships are validated against specific term dates
- Prevents retroactive application of current scholarships to past bills
- Ensures temporal accuracy for financial transactions

### 3. Payment Mode Flexibility
- **Direct Payment**: Student pays with NGO-provided funds
- **Bulk Invoice**: NGO receives consolidated invoice, students show zero balance

### 4. Transparent Transfer Mechanism
- When NGO drops a student, financial responsibility transfers atomically
- Complete audit trail maintained
- Automatic notifications to all parties

## Architecture Components

### 1. Unified Scholarship Service

```python
from apps.scholarships.services import UnifiedScholarshipService

# Main entry point for finance system
benefit = UnifiedScholarshipService.get_scholarship_for_term(
    student=student,
    term=current_term
)

# Returns ScholarshipBenefit with:
# - has_scholarship: bool
# - discount_percentage: Decimal
# - source_type: "NGO" | "NON_NGO" | "NONE"
# - payment_mode: "DIRECT" | "BULK_INVOICE"
# - requires_bulk_invoice: bool
```

### 2. NGO Portal Service

Provides bulk operations for clerical efficiency:

```python
from apps.scholarships.services import NGOPortalService

# Dashboard data for NGO
dashboard = NGOPortalService.get_ngo_dashboard_data("CRST")

# Bulk import students
results = NGOPortalService.bulk_import_sponsored_students(
    sponsor_code="CRST",
    student_data=[...]
)

# Generate bulk invoice
invoice = NGOPortalService.generate_bulk_invoice(
    sponsor=sponsor,
    term=fall_2024
)
```

### 3. Transfer Service

Handles dropped NGO students:

```python
from apps.scholarships.services import NGOScholarshipTransferService

# Transfer individual student
result = NGOScholarshipTransferService.transfer_scholarship_to_student(
    sponsored_student=relationship,
    end_date=today,
    reason="Student withdrawn by NGO"
)

# Bulk transfer all students from NGO
results = NGOScholarshipTransferService.bulk_transfer_ngo_students(
    sponsor_code="CRST",
    reason="NGO agreement terminated"
)
```

## Payment Flows

### Direct Payment Mode
1. Student has NGO sponsorship with `payment_mode=DIRECT`
2. Student receives bill with NGO discount applied
3. Student pays using funds provided by NGO
4. Normal payment processing

### Bulk Invoice Mode
1. Student has NGO sponsorship with `payment_mode=BULK_INVOICE`
2. Student sees zero balance on their account
3. NGO receives consolidated invoice for all students
4. NGO pays bulk invoice directly to school
5. Payments allocated to individual student accounts

## Benefits

### For Clerical Staff
- Manage 100-150 NGO students as groups, not individuals
- Bulk import/export operations
- Automated invoice generation
- One-click report generation

### For NGOs
- Real-time dashboards
- Automated reporting per preferences
- Transparent student performance tracking
- Flexible payment options

### For Students
- Clear understanding of funding source
- Seamless transition if dropped by NGO
- No manual intervention needed

### For Finance System
- Single interface regardless of scholarship type
- Automatic best-deal selection
- Date-validated scholarship application
- Complete audit trail

## Management Commands

```bash
# Import NGO students from CSV
python manage.py manage_ngo_scholarships import CRST students.csv

# Transfer dropped student
python manage.py manage_ngo_scholarships transfer CRST --student-id 12345

# Generate NGO report
python manage.py manage_ngo_scholarships report CRST --type comprehensive

# List NGO students
python manage.py manage_ngo_scholarships list CRST --active-only
```

## Admin Interface

The Django admin has been enhanced with:
- Payment mode indicators (ðŸ’µ Direct, ðŸ“„ Bulk Invoice)
- Quick filters for payment modes
- Bulk operations for NGO students
- Clear visual indicators for scholarship status

## Migration Strategy

1. Existing NGO scholarships can continue using `Scholarship` model
2. New NGO relationships should use `SponsoredStudent` only
3. Gradual migration as scholarships expire
4. No breaking changes to existing code

## Testing

Comprehensive test coverage includes:
- Temporal validation scenarios
- Payment mode handling
- Transfer operations
- NGO vs non-NGO precedence
- Edge cases and error conditions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Automated Notifications**: Email/SMS for scholarship changes
2. **Self-Service Portal**: NGOs manage their own students
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Predictive modeling for at-risk students
4. **API Integration**: RESTful API for external NGO systems
5. **Blockchain Verification**: Immutable scholarship records
