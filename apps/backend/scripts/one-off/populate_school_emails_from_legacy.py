Populate Person.school_email field with school_email from legacy_students table.

This script matches Person records with legacy_students using StudentProfile.student_id
and updates the Person.school_email field which is currently mostly blank.

Usage:
    # Dry run to see what would be updated
    docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml run --rm django \
        python scripts/one-off/populate_school_emails_from_legacy.py --dry-run

    # Execute the updates
    docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml run --rm django \
        python scripts/one-off/populate_school_emails_from_legacy.py

    # Limit for testing
    docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml run --rm django \
        python scripts/one-off/populate_school_emails_from_legacy.py --limit 100
