"""Extract Student Records functionality files for review.

This script copies all files involved in the "Student Records" sidebar functionality,
generating one .txt file that can be reviewed. It includes the complete file chain
from sidebar link through to the final table rendering.

Usage:
    python scripts/extract_student_records.py

Files included:
- HTML Templates: sidebar, base templates, CRUD templates, student-specific templates
- Python Files: URLs, views, and related logic
- CSS Files: Project styles, layout, and main stylesheets
- JavaScript: Embedded functionality for table management

The output contains the complete implementation of the Student Records feature.
