## 🚀 Quick Start

### Test Locally Right Now:
```bash
# Check what CI will see:
./scripts/mypy-new-files-ci.sh

# Quick quality check:
uv run ruff format .
uv run ruff check --diff
```

### In PyCharm:
1. **Preferences** → **Tools** → **External Tools** → **+**
2. **Name**: `Mypy Current File`  
3. **Program**: `mypy`
4. **Arguments**: `--follow-imports=silent $FilePath$`
5. **Working Directory**: `$ProjectFileDir$`

## 🎯 Key Benefits

### ✅ **No Constant Failures**
- Pipeline focuses on NEW issues only
- Existing technical debt doesn't block development
- Security and dependency issues warn but don't fail

### ✅ **Fast Feedback** 
- Smoke tests complete in 5 minutes
- Most PRs finish quality checks in 10 minutes
- Integration tests only run when needed

### ✅ **Gradual Improvement**
- Team can fix issues incrementally  
- New code held to higher standards
- Legacy code cleaned up over time

### ✅ **Developer Friendly**
- Clear error messages with fix suggestions
- Local testing matches CI exactly
- PyCharm integration for immediate feedback

## 🏁 Next Steps

### 1. **Enable the Workflow**
- Push `.github/workflows/quality-check.yml` to your repo
- First run will establish baselines
- All future PRs will be checked

### 2. **Team Adoption**
```bash
# Add to your team's daily workflow:
./scripts/mypy-new-files-ci.sh  # Before push
uv run ruff format .            # Auto-format
```

### 3. **Gradual Tightening**
- After 2 weeks of stable CI, consider increasing strictness
- Pick one module per sprint to clean up legacy issues  
- Celebrate improvements in team retrospectives

## 🐛 If Something Breaks

### MyPy Issues
- Check `mypy.ini` settings
- Use `# type: ignore[error-code]` temporarily  
- Focus on new files, ignore legacy for now

### CI Taking Too Long
- Most runs < 15 minutes is normal
- Integration tests only run on main branch
- Split large PRs if needed

### Too Many Failures
- This pipeline is designed to be realistic
- If you're seeing constant failures, something's wrong
- Check `CI_CD_GUIDE.md` for troubleshooting
