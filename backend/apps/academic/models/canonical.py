"""Canonical requirement models implementing "Canonical as default, exception as override" pattern.

This module defines the new canonical requirement system that addresses the architectural
flaws in the flexible requirement system. The new design follows these principles:

DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
1. Single Source of Truth: Course.credits is the ONLY source for course credit values
2. Canonical Requirements: Exactly 43 courses for BA degree (rigid, non-negotiable)
3. Exception-Based Overrides: Study abroad, transfers, substitutions handled separately
4. Clean Architecture: No dual credit authority, no flexible credit systems

IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:
- CanonicalRequirement: Complete, populated for 5 majors (BUSADMIN, TESOL, FIN-BANK, IR, TOUR-HOSP)
- StudentDegreeProgress: Structure complete, recalculate_progress() in services

    """Canonical degree requirements - exactly 43 courses for BA degree.

    This model represents the rigid, non-negotiable course sequence that every
    student in a major must complete. There are no flexible credits or electives
    at the canonical level - every requirement specifies exactly one course.

    Key features:
    - Rigid 1-to-1 mapping: requirement â†’ course
    - Sequential numbering (1-43 for BA degree, 1-24 for MA degree)
    - Single source of truth for credit values (Course.credits)
    - Term-based versioning for curriculum changes
    - No override fields or flexible credit systems
    - Supports multiple major programs with different requirement counts

    Example usage:
        # Get all requirements for a major
        requirements = CanonicalRequirement.objects.filter(
            major__code='BUSADMIN',
            is_active=True
        ).order_by('sequence_number')

        # Check canonical credits for a requirement
        credits = requirement.canonical_credits  # From Course.credits
