## Core Reconciliation Services

### Comprehensive Reconciliation Service

Located at `apps.finance.services.comprehensive_reconciliation_service.py`, this service handles:
- CSV payment data processing
- Automatic discount verification
- Scholarship validation
- Exception handling and error categorization

Key features:
- Pattern matching for discount identification
- Integration with DiscountRule table
- Automated confidence scoring
- Detailed error tracking

### SIS Integration Test Service

The `SISIntegrationTestService` (in `apps.finance.management.commands.run_sis_integration_test.py`) provides comprehensive validation by:

1. **Using SeparatedPricingService** to calculate actual course prices
2. **Looking up scholarships** in the Scholarship table to verify percentages
3. **Using DiscountRule table** to match Early Bird and other discounts from notes
4. **Comparing SIS calculated values** to clerk's notes and flagging differences
5. **Creating detailed error tracking** for all discrepancies

This service acts as a comprehensive integration test comparing the entire SIS against historical payment data and flagging any clerk errors or system discrepancies.

## Reconciliation Models

### ReconciliationBatch

Tracks batch processing of reconciliation runs:

```python
class ReconciliationBatch(TimestampedModel, UserTrackingModel):
    batch_id = models.CharField(max_length=100, unique=True)
    batch_type = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=BatchType.choices)
    status = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=BatchStatus.choices)
    
    # Statistics
    total_payments = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=0)
    processed_payments = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=0)
    successful_matches = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=0)
    failed_matches = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=0)
    
    # Results
    results_summary = models.JSONField(default=dict)
    error_log = models.TextField(blank=True)
```

### ReconciliationStatus

Tracks individual payment reconciliation status:

```python
class ReconciliationStatus(TimestampedModel, UserTrackingModel):
    payment = models.ForeignKey('finance.Payment', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    status = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=Status.choices)
    confidence_level = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=ConfidenceLevel.choices)
    confidence_score = models.DecimalField(max_digits=5, decimal_places=2)
    
    # Variance tracking
    variance_amount = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    pricing_method_applied = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    
    # Error details
    error_category = models.CharField(max_length=50, blank=True)
    error_details = models.JSONField(default=dict)
```

## Reconciliation Workflow

### 1. Data Import and Parsing

```python
# Parse CSV payment data
csv_data = CSVPaymentData(
    student_id=row['name'],
    term_code=row['TermID'],
    amount=Decimal(row['Amount']),
    net_amount=Decimal(row['NetAmount']),
    net_discount=Decimal(row['NetDiscount']),
    notes=row['Notes'],
    payment_type=row['PmtType'],
    payment_date=row['PmtDate'],
    receipt_number=row['ReceiptNo']
)
```

### 2. SIS Calculation

```python
# Calculate pricing using actual SIS pricing service
sis_calculation = service._calculate_sis_pricing(
    student=student,
    term=term,
    enrollments=enrollments
)

# Returns SISCalculation object with:
# - base_price: Total tuition before discounts
# - scholarship_discount: Amount from scholarships
# - discount_amount: Other discounts (Early Bird, etc.)
# - expected_net_amount: Final calculated amount
```

### 3. Clerk Entry Parsing

```python
# Parse clerk's notes to extract recorded values
clerk_entry = service._parse_clerk_notes(csv_data)

# Extracts:
# - recorded_discount_percentage
# - recorded_discount_amount  
# - scholarship_mentioned
# - discount_type_mentioned
```

### 4. Discrepancy Identification

The service identifies several types of discrepancies:

- **MISSING_SCHOLARSHIP_RECORD**: Clerk mentioned scholarship but none found in SIS
- **UNREPORTED_SCHOLARSHIP**: SIS shows scholarship but clerk didn't record it
- **SCHOLARSHIP_PERCENTAGE_MISMATCH**: Different percentages between SIS and clerk
- **EARLY_BIRD_PERCENTAGE_MISMATCH**: Discount percentage doesn't match rule
- **NET_AMOUNT_MISMATCH**: Final amounts don't match

### 5. Confidence Scoring

```python
# Determine confidence based on discrepancies
if not discrepancies:
    confidence_level = HIGH
    confidence_score = 95%
elif any(d.severity in ['HIGH', 'CRITICAL'] for d in discrepancies):
    confidence_level = NONE
    confidence_score = 20%
elif any(d.severity == 'MEDIUM' for d in discrepancies):
    confidence_level = LOW
    confidence_score = 60%
else:
    confidence_level = MEDIUM
    confidence_score = 80%
```

## Usage Examples

### Running SIS Integration Test

```bash
# Run comprehensive integration test
python manage.py run_sis_integration_test /path/to/payments.csv \
    --batch-name "SPRING-2024-TEST" \
    --limit 1000 \
    --verbose

# Output shows:
# üöÄ Starting SIS Integration Test Reconciliation
# üìÑ CSV File: /path/to/payments.csv
# üìä Limit: 1000 records
# 
# üö® HIGH: CLERK ERROR: Scholarship percentage mismatch - SIS calculated 50% but clerk recorded 40%
# üìä Processed 50 payments...
# 
# üéâ SIS Integration Test Complete!
# üìä Total Processed: 1000
# ‚úÖ Successful: 950
# ‚ùå Errors: 50
# ‚ö†Ô∏è Payments with Discrepancies: 75
```

### Processing Individual Payment

```python
from apps.finance.services.sis_integration_test_service import (
    SISIntegrationTestService,
    CSVPaymentData
)

service = SISIntegrationTestService(user=request.user)

# Process single payment
csv_data = CSVPaymentData(
    student_id="John Doe",
    term_code="2024-1",
    amount=Decimal("1500.00"),
    net_amount=Decimal("1350.00"),
    net_discount=Decimal("150.00"),
    notes="10% early bird discount applied",
    payment_type="CASH",
    payment_date="2024-01-15",
    receipt_number="RCP-2024-001"
)

status, discrepancies = service.process_payment_integration_test(csv_data)

# Review discrepancies
for disc in discrepancies:
    print(f"{disc.severity}: {disc.description}")
    print(f"SIS Value: {disc.sis_value}, Clerk Value: {disc.clerk_value}")
```

### Batch Reconciliation Review

```python
# Review batch results
batch = ReconciliationBatch.objects.get(batch_id="SPRING-2024-TEST")

# Check summary
print(f"Success Rate: {batch.results_summary['success_rate']}%")
print(f"Discrepancy Count: {batch.results_summary['discrepancy_count']}")

# Review discrepancy breakdown
for disc_type, count in batch.results_summary['discrepancies_by_type'].items():
    print(f"{disc_type}: {count} occurrences")

# Find high-severity issues
critical_issues = ReconciliationStatus.objects.filter(
    reconciliation_batch=batch,
    confidence_level=ReconciliationStatus.ConfidenceLevel.NONE
)
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Data Preparation

- **Clean CSV Data**: Ensure consistent formatting and encoding
- **Validate Required Fields**: Check for NULL values and empty strings
- **Standardize Dates**: Use consistent date formats
- **Normalize Names**: Handle name variations and duplicates

### 2. Reconciliation Configuration

- **Set Appropriate Thresholds**: Configure variance tolerances
- **Define Severity Levels**: Establish clear criteria for HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
- **Enable Verbose Logging**: Use --verbose flag for troubleshooting
- **Process in Batches**: Use reasonable limits to avoid timeouts

### 3. Error Handling

- **Review Exception Categories**: 
  - MISSING_STUDENT_OR_TERM
  - NO_ENROLLMENTS
  - PROCESSING_ERROR
- **Track Error Patterns**: Monitor recurring issues
- **Document Resolutions**: Record how discrepancies were resolved

### 4. Performance Optimization

```python
# Use select_related for efficient queries
enrollments = ClassHeaderEnrollment.objects.filter(
    student=student,
    class_header__term=term
).select_related(
    'class_header__course',
    'class_header'
)

# Process in chunks for large datasets
for chunk in chunk_list(payments, size=100):
    process_chunk(chunk)
```

### 5. Audit Trail

- **Maintain Complete History**: Keep all reconciliation runs
- **Document Manual Adjustments**: Record why changes were made
- **Track User Actions**: Use UserTrackingModel fields
- **Generate Reports**: Create summaries for management review

## Integration with Other Services

### Pricing Service Integration

The reconciliation service uses `SeparatedPricingService` for accurate pricing:

```python
course_price, pricing_description = self.pricing_service.calculate_course_price(
    course=enrollment.class_header.course,
    student=student,
    term=term,
    class_header=enrollment.class_header
)
```

### Scholarship Service Integration

Validates scholarships against actual records:

```python
active_scholarships = Scholarship.objects.filter(
    student=student,
    status__in=[Scholarship.AwardStatus.APPROVED, Scholarship.AwardStatus.ACTIVE],
    start_date__lte=term.end_date
)
```

### Discount Rule Integration

Matches clerk notes against configured discount rules:

```python
for pattern, rule in self.discount_rules_cache.items():
    if pattern in notes.lower():
        expected_percentage = rule.discount_percentage
        # Verify against clerk's recorded percentage
```

## Troubleshooting
