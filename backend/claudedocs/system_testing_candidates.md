## Student Categories for Testing

### 1. Immediate Testing Ready (252 students)
**Criteria**: In our processed terms (240821B-T3, 241007E-T4AE, 241125B-T4)
**Confidence**: HIGHEST - data fully processed and validated
**Use Cases**: Core system functionality, enrollment workflows, grade management

### 2. Extended Testing Pool (151 students)
**Criteria**: Other 2024 terms with enrollment data
**Confidence**: HIGH - recent activity with enrollment records
**Use Cases**: Historical data validation, reporting features

### 3. Forward Testing Group (1,285 students)
**Criteria**: 2025 projected terms with program status
**Confidence**: MEDIUM-HIGH - projected but systematically tracked
**Use Cases**: Planning features, future enrollment, capacity management

## System Testing Recommendations

### Phase 1: Core Validation (252 students)
- Focus on students from our 3 processed terms
- Test enrollment workflows, grade entry, attendance tracking
- Validate academic records and transcript generation

### Phase 2: Extended Validation (403 students total)
- Add the 151 students from other 2024 terms
- Test historical data integration
- Validate reporting and analytics features

### Phase 3: Forward Planning (1,688 students total)
- Include all high-confidence students
- Test capacity planning and future enrollment features
- Validate projection and planning tools

## Data Quality Assurance

### Strengths
- âœ… **Double Validation**: Students verified in both systems
- âœ… **Clean Processing**: Enrollment data successfully processed
- âœ… **Recent Activity**: All students have 2024-2025 activity
- âœ… **Representative Sample**: Mix of terms and program levels

### Applied Simplifications
- âœ… **Date Standardization**: Handling MSSQL datetime format
- âœ… **BA Graduation Logic**: Applied user-specified graduation rules
- âœ… **Status Categories**: Simplified to current status vs. full history
- âœ… **Cross-Validation**: Verified student existence in both systems

## Implementation Status

âœ… **COMPLETED**:
- Program dates analysis (18,157 records)
- Recent terms cross-reference (5,537 records)
