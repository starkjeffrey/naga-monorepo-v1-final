o# StudentDegreeProgress Model Analysis

## Overview

The `StudentDegreeProgress` model at `/apps/academic/canonical_models.py:442-582` is a comprehensive degree tracking system that implements the "Canonical as default, exception as override" pattern. This analysis provides a complete examination of the model's purpose, architecture, and integration within the Naga SIS canonical requirement system.

## Purpose & Architecture

### Core Function

Tracks individual student progress through canonical degree requirements by combining canonical requirements with approved exceptions to provide cached degree audit functionality.

### Design Pattern

Part of the new canonical requirement system that replaces the problematic flexible requirement architecture from version 0.

## Key Features

### 1. Progress Tracking Fields

- `total_requirements`: Total canonical requirements for the major (e.g., 43 for BA)
- `completed_requirements`: Requirements completed or satisfied by exception
- `total_credits_required`: Total credits needed for graduation
- `credits_completed`: Credits earned through courses and approved exceptions
- `completion_percentage`: Overall degree completion percentage (0-100)

### 2. Status Management

- `completion_status`: IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, ON_HOLD, WITHDRAWN
- `estimated_graduation_term`: Projected graduation timeline
- `last_updated`: Auto-updated timestamp for recalculation tracking

### 3. Business Logic Properties

- `is_graduation_eligible`: Checks if student meets all completion criteria
- `remaining_requirements`: Calculates outstanding requirements
- `remaining_credits`: Calculates outstanding credit hours

## Integration with Canonical System

### Relationship to Other Models

- Links `student` to specific `major` (unique together constraint)
- Works with `CanonicalRequirement` (43 rigid course requirements)
- Incorporates `StudentRequirementException` (transfer credits, substitutions, waivers)

### Data Flow

```
Canonical Requirements (43 courses)
    + Student Requirement Exceptions (approved overrides)
    = Student Degree Progress (cached summary)
```

## Operational Benefits

### 1. Performance Optimization

- Cached calculations avoid expensive real-time requirement checks
- Fast degree audit queries for academic advising
- Indexed for efficient filtering by completion status and graduation term

### 2. Academic Advising Support

- Clear progress visualization (percentage complete)
- Graduation eligibility determination
- Timeline estimation for degree completion

### 3. Administrative Workflow

- Automatic updates when exceptions are approved
- Progress tracking across multiple major programs
- Status management for holds and withdrawals

## Current Implementation Status

### Implemented

Complete model structure with validation, properties, and database constraints

### Pending

The `recalculate_progress()` method (lines 578-582) is declared but not implemented - this would be the core business logic that:

- Queries canonical requirements for the student's major
- Checks completed courses against requirements
- Incorporates approved exceptions
- Updates all progress fields automatically

## Integration with Recent Work

This model connects directly to our recent canonical requirements population:

- **Canonical Requirements**: Now populated for 5 majors (BUSADMIN, TESOL, FIN-BANK, IR, TOUR-HOSP)
- **Admin Filtering**: Properly filtered to exclude Language Division courses
- **Fulfillment Tracking**: Works with the `populate_course_fulfillments.py` script we fixed

The model represents the final piece of the degree audit system - providing students and advisors with clear, accurate progress tracking based on the canonical curriculum we've established.

## Model Structure Details

### Database Schema

```python
class StudentDegreeProgress(AuditModel):
    student = ForeignKey("people.StudentProfile", on_delete=CASCADE)
    major = ForeignKey("curriculum.Major", on_delete=PROTECT)

    # Progress tracking
    total_requirements = PositiveSmallIntegerField()
    completed_requirements = PositiveSmallIntegerField(default=0)
    total_credits_required = PositiveSmallIntegerField()
    credits_completed = DecimalField(max_digits=6, decimal_places=2, default=0.00)

    # Status tracking
    completion_status = CharField(choices=CompletionStatus.choices)
    completion_percentage = PositiveSmallIntegerField(default=0, max=100)
    estimated_graduation_term = ForeignKey("curriculum.Term", null=True)

    # Administrative tracking
    last_updated = DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    notes = TextField(blank=True)
```

### Constraints and Indexes

- **Unique Together**: `[student, major]` - One progress record per student per major
- **Indexes**: Optimized for queries by student+status, major+status, completion percentage, and graduation term

### Validation Rules

- Completion percentage must be 0-100
- Graduation eligibility requires 100% completion and COMPLETED status
- Last updated timestamp automatically maintained

## Future Implementation Notes

### recalculate_progress() Implementation

When implemented, this method should:

1. **Query canonical requirements** for the student's major
2. **Check course completions** against each requirement
3. **Apply approved exceptions** (transfer credits, substitutions, waivers)
4. **Calculate totals**:
   - Total requirements (from canonical count)
   - Completed requirements (courses + exceptions)
   - Total credits required (sum of canonical course credits)
   - Credits completed (actual credits earned)
   - Completion percentage (completed/total \* 100)
5. **Update status** based on completion criteria
6. **Save updated progress** with new timestamp

### Performance Considerations

- Should be called when:
  - Student completes a course
  - Exception is approved/rejected
  - Canonical requirements change
  - Manual recalculation requested
- Consider batch processing for large updates
- Cache invalidation strategy for related queries
