#### Academic (Business Logic)
**Needs Tests For:**
- Requirement checking
- Equivalency rules
- Graduation audits
- Academic standing calculations

#### Academic_records
**Needs Tests For:**
- Transcript generation
- Official document creation
- Record verification

#### Level_testing
**Needs Tests For:**
- Placement test workflows
- Fee processing
- Result recording

#### Analytics
**Needs Tests For:**

- Course mapping
- User synchronization

#### Web_interface
**Needs Tests For:**

- Form submissions
- Template logic

## Architectural Issues Found

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ISSUES

1. **Circular Dependencies Detected:**
   - `common` imports from `enrollment` (VIOLATION of foundation layer independence)
   - `people` imports from `enrollment` and `scholarships` (potential circular dependency)
   - `enrollment` imports from `academic` while `academic` depends on `enrollment`

2. **Missing Test Isolation:**
   - Many tests directly create related objects instead of using mocks
   - Tests depend on actual database state
   - No use of pytest fixtures for better isolation

3. **Inconsistent Test Patterns:**
   - Mix of unittest.TestCase and Django TestCase
   - No pytest usage despite Python 3.13 environment
   - Inconsistent naming conventions

4. **Database Dependencies:**
   - Tests require full PostgreSQL setup
   - No SQLite optimization for unit tests
   - Missing transaction rollback patterns

## Test Scenarios to Add

### Critical User Journeys (E2E)
1. **Student Registration Flow**
   - Account creation â†’ Profile setup â†’ Program selection â†’ Course enrollment â†’ Invoice generation

2. **Grade Submission Flow**
   - Teacher login â†’ Class selection â†’ Grade entry â†’ Approval â†’ GPA calculation â†’ Transcript update

3. **Payment Processing Flow**
   - Invoice generation â†’ Payment submission â†’ Receipt generation â†’ Account update

4. **Attendance Tracking Flow**
   - Session creation â†’ Code generation â†’ Student check-in â†’ Report generation

### Security Scenarios
1. **Multi-tenant Isolation**
   - Ensure students can't see other students' grades
   - Teachers only access their classes
   - Financial data isolation

2. **Permission Boundaries**
   - Role-based access control
   - API authentication
   - Admin-only operations

### Performance Scenarios
1. **Bulk Operations**
   - Batch enrollment processing
   - Mass grade uploads
   - Term-end calculations

2. **Concurrent Access**
   - Multiple students enrolling in limited capacity class
   - Simultaneous grade submissions
   - Payment race conditions

### Data Validation Scenarios
1. **Business Rule Enforcement**
   - Prerequisites checking
   - Credit limit validation
   - GPA requirements

2. **Data Integrity**
   - Foreign key constraints
   - Unique constraints
   - Check constraints

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Set up pytest infrastructure
   - Create base fixtures and factories
   - Fix circular dependencies
   - Add tests for authentication (accounts app)

2. **High Priority:**
   - Test common utilities (foundation layer)
   - Test people management (core domain)
   - Add API tests for all endpoints

3. **Testing Strategy:**
   - Use pytest exclusively for consistency
   - Implement factory_boy for all models
   - Use SQLite for unit tests, PostgreSQL only for integration
   - Add parametrized tests for edge cases

4. **Coverage Goals:**
   - Common, Accounts, People: 95%+ (critical foundation)
   - Academic, Enrollment, Finance: 90%+ (core business)
   - All others: 80%+ minimum

## Next Steps

1. Set up pytest configuration with proper plugins
2. Create base test infrastructure
3. Generate factories for all models
4. Start with foundation layer (common, accounts)
5. Fix architectural violations as discovered
