## Dependency Summary

### Apps with Most Migration Dependencies

The following apps have the highest number of migration dependencies, indicating their central role in the database schema:

| App | Migrations | Dependencies | Notes |
|-----|------------|--------------|-------|
| **finance** | 39 | 60 | Financial transactions, pricing, invoicing |
| **enrollment** | 22 | 39 | Student enrollment, academic journeys |
| **scheduling** | 16 | 24 | Class scheduling, rooms, time slots |
| **academic** | 11 | 17 | Academic records, transcripts, degrees |
| **curriculum** | 14 | 15 | Courses, programs, academic structure |
| **people** | 13 | 14 | Person profiles, staff/student data |
| **common** | 7 | 9 | Shared utilities, base models |
| **language** | 3 | 9 | Language-specific functionality |
| **grading** | 4 | 9 | Grade management and calculations |
| **scholarships** | 7 | 9 | Financial aid and scholarship management |

### Migrations with Most Dependencies

These migrations have the highest number of dependencies, typically representing major schema additions:

| Migration | Dependencies | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| `grading.0002_initial` | 5 | Initial grading system setup |
| `academic_records.0005_add_document_quota_models` | 5 | Document quota system |
| `language.0002_initial` | 4 | Language functionality initialization |
| `language.0001_initial_squashed_0002_initial` | 4 | Squashed language migrations |
| `enrollment.0002_initial` | 4 | Core enrollment system setup |

## Architecture Observations

### Clean Architecture Validation

The absence of circular dependencies confirms that the Django app architecture follows clean architecture principles:

- **Foundation Layer** (`accounts/`, `common/`) - No circular dependencies
- **Core Domain** (`people/`, `curriculum/`, `scheduling/`, `enrollment/`) - Proper dependency hierarchy
- **Business Logic** (`academic/`, `grading/`, `attendance/`, `finance/`, `scholarships/`) - Dependencies flow downward
- **Services** (`academic_records/`, `level_testing/`, `language/`) - Service layer dependencies are clean

### Dependency Flow Analysis

The dependency structure shows a healthy pattern:
- Core foundation models are established first
- Business logic models depend on core models
- Service layer models depend on business logic models
- No backwards dependencies creating cycles

## Recommendations

1. **✅ Current State**: The migration structure is excellent and should be maintained
2. **Monitor**: Continue running this analysis before major releases
3. **Process**: Consider adding this check to CI/CD pipeline to prevent future circular dependencies
4. **Documentation**: This clean dependency structure supports maintainable code architecture

## Technical Details

### Analysis Methodology

The analysis used the following approach:

1. **Collection**: Parsed all migration files using Python AST
2. **Dependency Extraction**: Extracted `dependencies = [...]` declarations from each migration
3. **Graph Construction**: Built directed dependency graph
4. **Cycle Detection**: Used depth-first search to detect circular dependencies
5. **Reporting**: Generated human-readable analysis with statistics

### Apps Analyzed

The following project apps were included in the analysis:

- `accounts` - Authentication and user management
- `academic` - Academic records and transcripts  
- `academic_records` - Document requests and quotas
- `attendance` - Attendance tracking
- `common` - Shared utilities and models
- `curriculum` - Courses and programs
- `data_pipeline` - Data processing pipeline
- `enrollment` - Student enrollment management
- `finance` - Billing and financial transactions
- `grading` - Grade management
- `language` - Language-specific functionality
- `level_testing` - Placement testing
- `mobile` - Mobile app support
- `people` - Person profiles and contacts
- `scholarships` - Financial aid management
- `scheduling` - Class and room scheduling
- `users` - User account extensions
- `web_interface` - Web UI components

### Command Usage

To reproduce this analysis:

```bash
# Basic analysis
python manage.py detect_circular_migrations

# Detailed analysis (used for this report)
python manage.py detect_circular_migrations --show-details --exclude-third-party

# Analyze specific apps only
python manage.py detect_circular_migrations --apps finance enrollment academic

# Include third-party migrations
python manage.py detect_circular_migrations --show-details
```
