- 🟡 **Data Consistency**: Ensuring real-time updates don't cause conflicts
- 🟡 **Performance**: Large student lists need pagination/virtualization

### Low Risk Areas
- 🟢 **Static Content**: Simple display components
- 🟢 **Navigation**: Already working in React
- 🟢 **Basic CRUD**: Standard patterns well understood

## 8. Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
