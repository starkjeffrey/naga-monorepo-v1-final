# Smart Comment Remover

Intelligently removes obvious and redundant comments while preserving valuable documentation and important explanations across Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Vue files.

## Features

### Multi-Language Support
- **Python**: Full support for `#` comments and docstrings
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Support for `//` and `/* */` comments
- **Vue**: Support for template and script comments
- **Extensible**: Easy to add support for more languages

### Smart Classification

#### Comments We KEEP (Preserved)
- **API Documentation**: JSDoc, docstrings, function descriptions
- **Business Logic**: Complex algorithm explanations
- **Warnings & TODOs**: WARNING, FIXME, HACK, TODO, NOTE comments
- **Copyright/License**: Legal and attribution comments
- **Configuration**: Environment, production settings explanations
- **Security Notes**: Authentication, authorization, vulnerability notes
- **External References**: URLs, ticket numbers, specifications
- **Long Comments**: Comments >80 characters (likely valuable)
- **Multi-sentence**: Comments with multiple sentences

#### Comments We REMOVE (Redundant)
- **Obvious Assignments**: "Set name to John" next to `name = "John"`
- **Obvious Operations**: "Increment counter" next to `count += 1`
- **Obvious Loops**: "Loop through users" next to `for user in users:`
- **Deprecated References**: "Replaces deprecated old_function()"
- **End Markers**: "End of function", "End of loop"
- **Useless States**: "Done", "Finished", "Complete"
- **Debug Comments**: Temporary debugging explanations
- **Django Obvious**: "Save the model" next to `model.save()`

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Dry run (shows what would be changed, doesn't modify files)
python scripts/development/smart_comment_remover.py apps/ --dry-run

# See detailed analysis of each comment
python scripts/development/smart_comment_remover.py apps/attendance/services.py --dry-run --analysis

# Actually modify files (removes --dry-run)
python scripts/development/smart_comment_remover.py apps/ --execute
```

### Language-Specific Processing

```bash
# Python files only
python scripts/development/smart_comment_remover.py apps/ --languages python --execute

# JavaScript/TypeScript only
python scripts/development/smart_comment_remover.py frontend/src/ --languages javascript --execute

# All supported languages (default)
python scripts/development/smart_comment_remover.py . --languages all --dry-run
```

### Options

| Option | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--dry-run` | Show changes without modifying files (default) | `--dry-run` |
| `--execute` | Actually modify files (removes dry-run) | `--execute` |
| `--analysis` | Show detailed reasoning for each comment | `--analysis` |
| `--languages` | Specify languages: python, javascript, typescript, vue, all | `--languages python` |

## Examples

### Before/After Examples

**REMOVES (Redundant):**
```python
# Set the user name  ← REMOVED
user.name = "John"

# Increment counter  ← REMOVED
count += 1

# Loop through items ← REMOVED
for item in items:
    process(item)

# Replaces deprecated old_function() ← REMOVED
def new_function():
    pass

# Done ← REMOVED
```

**KEEPS (Valuable):**
```python
# TODO: Add error handling for edge cases ← KEPT
# WARNING: This function has side effects ← KEPT
# This implements Dijkstra's algorithm with O(E + V log V) complexity ← KEPT
# See RFC 2616 section 4.2 for HTTP header requirements ← KEPT

def calculate_interest(principal: float, rate: float) -> float:
    """Calculate compound interest over time. ← KEPT (docstring)

    This uses the formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) where:
    - P is principal amount  ← KEPT (detailed explanation)
    - r is annual interest rate
    - n is compounding frequency
    """
    # Apply compounding formula - more complex than simple interest ← KEPT
    return principal * ((1 + rate) ** time)
```

## Monorepo Usage

### Backend (Python/Django)
```bash
# Process all Django apps
python scripts/development/smart_comment_remover.py apps/ --languages python --dry-run

# Specific app
python scripts/development/smart_comment_remover.py apps/attendance/ --execute

# All Python files including config
python scripts/development/smart_comment_remover.py . --languages python --dry-run
```

### Frontend (Vue/TypeScript)
```bash
# From backend directory, process frontend
python scripts/development/smart_comment_remover.py ../frontend/src/ --languages vue --dry-run

# JavaScript/TypeScript only
python scripts/development/smart_comment_remover.py ../frontend/src/ --languages typescript --execute
```

### Entire Monorepo
```bash
# Process everything (from monorepo root)
python backend/scripts/development/smart_comment_remover.py . --languages all --dry-run
```

## Safety Features

1. **Dry Run by Default**: Never modifies files unless `--execute` is specified
2. **Detailed Analysis**: `--analysis` flag shows reasoning for each decision
3. **Conservative Approach**: When in doubt, comments are preserved
4. **Pattern Validation**: Double-checks redundancy by comparing with actual code
5. **Language Detection**: Automatically detects file types and uses appropriate comment syntax

## Integration Tips

### Git Workflow
```bash
# Before committing, clean up obvious comments
python scripts/development/smart_comment_remover.py . --execute
git add -A
git commit -m "refactor: remove redundant comments"
```

### CI/CD Integration
Add to your linting pipeline:
```bash
# Check for obvious comments without modifying
python scripts/development/smart_comment_remover.py . --dry-run > comment_analysis.txt
```

### Code Review
Use before pull requests:
```bash
# Review what would be changed
python scripts/development/smart_comment_remover.py . --dry-run --analysis
```

## Configuration

The tool is configured via patterns in the source code:

- **KEEP_PATTERNS**: Regex patterns for comments to always preserve
- **REMOVE_PATTERNS**: Regex patterns for comments to remove
- **Language Support**: Easy to extend with new comment syntaxes

## Performance

- **Fast Processing**: Handles large codebases efficiently
- **Token Efficient**: Smart analysis reduces processing overhead
- **Parallel Safe**: Can be run on different directories simultaneously
- **Memory Efficient**: Processes files individually

## Limitations

1. **Context Sensitivity**: May not understand complex domain-specific comments
2. **Multi-line Comments**: Limited support for complex multi-line comment blocks
3. **Language Evolution**: New comment patterns may need manual addition
4. **Human Judgment**: Cannot replace human code review for nuanced decisions

## Contributing

To add support for new languages or improve pattern matching:

1. Add language detection in `detect_language()`
2. Add comment syntax in `_get_comment_chars()`
3. Add language-specific patterns to `KEEP_PATTERNS` or `REMOVE_PATTERNS`
4. Test with sample files from that language
