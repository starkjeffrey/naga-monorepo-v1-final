# Adaptive Navigation System Proposal

## Navigation Modes

### 1. **Dashboard Mode** (Default)
- Full sidebar visible with all navigation options
- Used for: Home, lists, reports, general navigation
- Content area: Standard width
- Example: Viewing student list, financial reports

### 2. **Focus Mode** (Auto-activated on detail views)
- Sidebar collapses to icons only (40px wide)
- Breadcrumb navigation appears at top
- Content area: Expanded width
- Example: Viewing individual student profile

### 3. **Immersive Mode** (Optional full-screen)
- Sidebar completely hidden
- Only breadcrumb navigation
- Content area: Full width
- Example: Complex data entry, report generation

## Key Features

### Smart Context Switching
- Automatically switches to Focus Mode when opening detail views
- Manual toggle available (Cmd/Ctrl + B)
- State persisted per user preference

### Role-Based Workspaces
1. **Student Services Workspace**
   - Quick access to student records
   - Enrollment management
   - Academic tracking

2. **Finance Workspace**
   - Billing dashboard
   - Payment processing
   - Scholarship management

3. **Academic Workspace**
   - Course management
   - Grading
   - Scheduling

### Unified Detail View Pattern
All detail views (student, course, financial record) follow the same pattern:
- Header with key info and status
- Contextual tab navigation
- Quick actions sidebar
- Activity/history panel

## Benefits
- **No Redundancy**: Single navigation system adapts to context
- **Space Efficient**: More room for content when needed
- **Consistent**: Same patterns across all modules
- **Fast Navigation**: Quick workspace switching
- **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive design built-in
