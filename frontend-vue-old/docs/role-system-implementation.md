# NAGA SIS - Teacher/Student Role System Implementation

**Project:** Dual-Role System Implementation  
**Started:** January 2025  
**Status:** 🚧 In Progress

## 🎯 Overview

Implementation of a dual-role system allowing seamless switching between teacher and student functionality within the same NAGA SIS app, based on analysis of legacy Vue 3 codebase.

## 🏗️ Architecture Summary

### Core Components
1. **Role Management**: Reactive composable with Pinia store integration
2. **Authentication**: Keycloak JWT token role extraction  
3. **Navigation**: Role-based routing with guards and dynamic menus
4. **UI Components**: Role switcher, role-aware layouts, conditional rendering
5. **Teacher Features**: Code generation, manual attendance, grades, courses

### Key Design Decisions
- **Single App**: One codebase with conditional rendering based on active role
- **Role Priority**: Default to 'student' if user has both roles
- **Navigation**: Separate route trees (`/student/*` and `/teacher/*`) 
- **Persistence**: Save role preference in localStorage
- **Mobile-First**: Optimized for mobile with desktop enhancements

## 🎨 UI/UX Considerations

### Role Identification
- **Visual Cues**: Different header colors, icons, and badges for each role
- **Navigation**: Role-specific bottom tabs and menu items  
- **Context**: Clear indication of active role in header/toolbar

### Mobile-First Design
- **Touch-Friendly**: Large buttons for teacher attendance marking
- **Quick Access**: Prominent role switcher in main navigation
- **Offline Support**: Full functionality without internet connection

## 🔒 Security & Permissions

### Route Protection
- Authentication required for all teacher/student routes
- Role-based access control with automatic redirects
- Development mode bypass for testing

### Data Isolation  
- Role-specific API endpoints and data caching
- Secure role validation from JWT tokens
- No cross-role data exposure

## 📱 Key Teacher Features to Implement

1. **Attendance Management**:
   - Generate 6-digit codes with configurable expiry (5-120 minutes)
   - Manual attendance with student photos and 4-status system
   - Real-time attendance statistics and reports

2. **Grade Management**:
   - Inline grade entry with automatic calculations
   - Assignment management and grading scales
   - Class statistics and export functionality

3. **Course Management**:
   - Active courses with enrollment information
   - Schedule and room assignments
   - Historical course access

4. **Communication**:
   - Class announcements and notifications
   - Student communication tools

## ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] Users can seamlessly switch between student and teacher roles
- [ ] All teacher features are fully functional and mobile-optimized
- [ ] Role-based navigation works correctly with proper permissions
- [ ] Offline functionality maintained for both roles
- [ ] Bilingual support (English/Khmer) for all teacher features
- [ ] Performance remains optimal with conditional rendering
