  ✅ Scripts Working Correctly

  Your package.json scripts are properly
  routing through Nx:
  - npm run dev → nx run-many --target=dev 
  --projects=backend,frontend
  --parallel=true ✓
  - npm run test → nx run-many --target=test
   --projects=backend,frontend
  --parallel=true ✓
  - npm run lint → nx run-many --target=lint
   --all --parallel=true ✓

  Summary: Nx is properly set up and will
  work correctly once the
  web-interface-scheduling worktree is
  merged or excluded from Nx processing.

> Don't concern yourself with that too much.
   I am asking about the base NX setup

⏺ You're right, focusing on the base Nx
  setup - it's properly configured:

  ✅ Nx Setup Status: CORRECT

  Core Nx Configuration

  - nx.json ✓ - Valid workspace config with
  proper plugins
  - package.json ✓ - Nx 21.2.1 installed
  with correct scripts
  - tsconfig.base.json ✓ - Base TypeScript
  configuration
  - Node engines ✓ - Node >=22.0.0, npm
  >=8.0.0

  Nx Plugins Active

  - @nx/js ✓ - JavaScript/TypeScript support
  - @nx/eslint/plugin ✓ - ESLint integration

  - @nx/jest/plugin ✓ - Jest testing support

  Project Structure

  - Root project (./project.json) ✓
  - Backend (backend/project.json) ✓ -
  Django application
  - Frontend (frontend/project.json) ✓ - Vue
   application
  - Shared library
  (libs/shared/api-types/project.json) ✓ -
  TypeScript types

  Nx Features Working

  - Caching ✓ - Enabled for build/test/lint
  - Dependencies ✓ - Projects properly
  declare implicit dependencies
  - Parallel execution ✓ - Scripts use
  --parallel=true
  - Target defaults ✓ - Proper caching and
  input configurations

  Package Scripts Integration

  All npm scripts properly route through Nx:
  npm run dev     # → nx run-many (backend +
   frontend)
  npm run test    # → nx run-many (both 
  projects)  
  npm run lint    # → nx run-many (all 
  projects)

  Bottom line: Nx monorepo setup is correct
  and functional.

> do I need to run NX commands to get the 
  most benefit from NX?

⏺ No, you don't need to run NX commands 
  directly. Your current setup maximizes Nx
  benefits through npm scripts.

  ✅ Your Current Approach is Optimal

  You're Already Getting Full Nx Benefits

  Your package.json scripts route through Nx
   automatically:
  npm run dev    # → nx run-many 
  --target=dev --parallel=true
  npm run test   # → nx run-many 
  --target=test --parallel=true  
  npm run lint   # → nx run-many 
  --target=lint --parallel=true

  Nx Features You're Already Using

  - Intelligent caching ✓ - Build/test/lint
  results cached
  - Parallel execution ✓ - Multiple projects
   run simultaneously
  - Dependency tracking ✓ - Changes trigger
  appropriate rebuilds
  - Affected commands ✓ - Available via npm 
  run affected:test

  When Direct Nx Commands Help

  # Project-specific tasks
  nx run frontend:dev        # Run only 
  frontend
  nx run backend:test:unit   # Run specific 
  backend test target

  # Development insights  
  nx graph                   # Visualize 
  project dependencies
  nx show projects           # List all 
  projects
  nx affected:test           # Test only 
  changed projects

  # Advanced workflows
  nx run-many --target=lint
  --projects=frontend,backend

  Best Practice: Stick With npm Scripts

  Your approach provides:
  - Consistent interface - Same commands
  across all environments
  - Team familiarity - Standard npm workflow

  - Full Nx power - All optimizations active
   behind the scenes
  - Flexibility - Can add direct Nx commands
   when needed

  You're maximizing Nx benefits without 
  complexity.

> If I want to develop in frontend/ and 
  backend/ simultaneously (e.g., to wrork on
   linking APIs), do I just launch claude at
   the base of the project?

⏺ Yes, launch Claude at the monorepo root
  (/Users/jeffreystark/PycharmProjects/naga-
  monorepo/) for full-stack development.

  ✅ Benefits of Root-Level Development

  Full Project Access

  - All projects - backend/, frontend/,
  libs/shared/api-types/
  - Shared types - Auto-sync API contracts
  between backend/frontend
  - Nx coordination - npm run dev starts
  both projects simultaneously

  API Development Workflow

  # At monorepo root
  npm run dev                    # Start 
  both backend + frontend
  npm run schema:update          # Sync API 
  types after backend changes
  npm run affected:test          # Test only
   what changed

  Claude Code Integration

  The root CLAUDE.md provides:
  - MCP servers - PostgreSQL, Context7,
  Playwright access
  - Docker-first guidance for backend
  operations
  - Nx commands for coordinated development
  - API schema sync workflow understanding

  Typical Full-Stack Workflow

  1. Modify Django models/APIs (backend/)
  2. Regenerate types (npm run 
  schema:update)
  3. Update Vue components (frontend/)
  4. Test integration (npm run test)

  Individual Project Focus

  When you need deep focus on one project:
  nx run frontend:dev     # Frontend only
  nx run backend:serve    # Backend only

  Root-level development gives you the full 
  monorepo power for API integration work.
