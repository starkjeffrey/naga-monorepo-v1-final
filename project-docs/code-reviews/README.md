### Historical Reviews
- **code_review_250625.md** - Comprehensive system-wide code review

## üéØ Review Focus Areas

### Architecture Compliance
- **Clean Architecture**: Verification of separation of concerns
- **Dependency Management**: No circular dependencies between apps
- **Single Responsibility**: Each app maintains focused domain responsibility
- **Interface Design**: Proper use of signals/events vs direct imports

### Code Quality Standards
- **Python Standards**: PEP 8 compliance, type hints, docstrings
- **Django Best Practices**: Model design, ORM usage, security patterns
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling and validation
- **Testing Coverage**: Unit tests, integration tests, business logic validation

### Business Logic Validation
- **Domain Rules**: Proper implementation of business requirements
- **Data Integrity**: Model constraints and validation logic
- **Academic Workflows**: Enrollment, grading, attendance business processes
- **Financial Logic**: Billing, payments, scholarship calculations

## üìä Review Methodology

### Static Analysis
- **Ruff linting** for code style and common issues
- **mypy type checking** for type safety validation
- **Security scanning** for potential vulnerabilities
- **Dependency analysis** for circular dependency detection

### Manual Review
- **Architecture assessment** against clean architecture principles
- **Business logic validation** against requirements
- **Code maintainability** and readability evaluation
- **Performance considerations** and optimization opportunities

### Testing Review
- **Test coverage** analysis and gap identification
- **Test quality** evaluation (unit vs integration)
- **Business scenario coverage** validation
- **Edge case handling** verification

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Review Standards

### App Boundary Validation
- **Domain Focus**: Each app should handle one business domain
- **Model Relationships**: Cross-app relationships via foreign keys, not imports
- **Service Layer**: Business logic encapsulated in services, not views
- **API Design**: Clean REST endpoints with proper serialization

### Dependency Review
- **Import Analysis**: No cross-app model imports
- **Signal Usage**: Proper event-driven communication between apps
- **Shared Code**: Common utilities in shared libraries
- **Third-party Dependencies**: Justified and maintained dependencies

## üìà Review Outcomes

### Quality Metrics
- **Code Coverage**: Target 90%+ for critical business logic
- **Type Coverage**: 100% type hints for public APIs
